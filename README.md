Welcome to my journey of becoming a frontend developer! This repository contains my daily studies, experiments, and projects related to JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and other frontend technologies. I am committed to learning and improving every day until I achieve my goal.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a journal of my daily progress as I learn and master frontend development. You'll find various scripts, mini-projects, and notes that showcase my learning process. Feel free to explore and use any of the code and resources here for your own learning purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core language for all my scripts and projects.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types for more robust code.
- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring content on the web.
- **CSS3**: Style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in my projects.
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for my repositories and collaborative projects.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects and exercises you will find in this repository:

- **JavaScript Basics**: Fundamental concepts and syntax of JavaScript.
- **TypeScript Basics**: Fundamental concepts and syntax of TypeScript.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Scripts that interact with and manipulate the DOM.
- **Form Handling**: Examples of working with forms, inputs, and validations.
